### Who am I?
I'm currently a data scientist in an e-commerce company, working on interesting projects such as competitive intelligence, smart voucher, category prediction. I am interesting to develop efficient and robust productive systems. 
Before joining the current company, I'm leading a data science team (~5 members) in a media company, working on user profiling, news recommendation, news tag classification, media content view forcasting.
